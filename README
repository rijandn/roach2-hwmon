Roach 2 hardware monitoring
---------------------------

The r2hwmond application monitors the roach sensors via the /sys/class/hwmon/
interface using the lm-sensors library.

Katcp is used to provide katcp logs and command to take action once an alarm is
triggered. Currently action is taken on the FPGA and PowerPC temperature alarms.

Under typical usage the r2hwmond application will be started from within
tcpborphserver:
    ?job process r2hwmond exec://r2hwmond

The application distinguish between a scan interval and an update interval:
    scan interval : check for alarms
    update interval: update sensor status (including value) information
    
The above intervals can also be set via the command line using the -s (scanTime)
and -u (updateTime) switches respectively. 
    
The following file/modules were re-used from lm-sensors/prog/sendord:
    chips.c/h
    sense.c/h
    sensord.h
