Roach 2 hardware monitoring
---------------------------

The r2hwmond application monitors the roach sensors via the /sys/class/hwmon/
interface using the lm-sensors library.

Katcp is used to provide katcp logs and command to take action once an alarm is
triggered.

It distinguish between a scan interval and an update interval:
    scan interval : check for alarms
    update interval: update sensor status (including value) information
